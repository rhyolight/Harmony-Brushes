This version of mrdoob's and rhyolight's Harmony application aims to provide
some extra functionality including:

- perspective brush
- better palette

Currently it provides following extra functionality:

- mirroring (x, y, radial)
- "sticky" palette (shift). Note that it's not possible to paint under the
  palette!
- vertical constraint (hit s while painting)
- horizontal constraint (hit a while painting)

You can find more information about Harmony at http://mrdoob.com/blog/post/689.
